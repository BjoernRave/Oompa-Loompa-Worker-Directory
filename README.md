# Oompa Loompa Worker Directory

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a small project I did for a job interview

It is created with React, React Router, Redux and Styled Components

To run it just clone or download this repo, run:

`npm install`

followed by:

`npm start`

and you can use it.
